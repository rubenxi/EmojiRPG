# 🌟EmojiRPG🌟
An RPG for Android using emojis as graphics, created from scratch in Android Studio.

This project was created to help me learn and improve my Java/Android programming skills, as well as to establish a foundation for developing a larger game in the future.

I developed the core mechanics for a turn-based combat system, a visual novel system for NPC interactions, a team management system, an overworld enemy path-tracking system, a gacha system, and more.

The game features animations throughout, all of which were handmade from scratch.

Because the game uses emoji codes for the graphics, everything will look different depending on the emoji set of each device, making it interesting to see how the game appears on different phones.


# ❓Why emojis?❓
Lacking drawing skills, I decided to use emojis because they are a standard set of images with a consistent artistic design, and they look good enough to use in the game.

Every graphic in the game, from the characters to the battles and scenery, uses emojis, with the only exception being the map background image.


# 💫Features💫

# 🗺️Interactive map🗺️
You can walk around the map and enter various locations. There’s a house for healing, a forest for combat, a library to manage your emoji team, a place for gacha pulls, and more.

More locations will be added in the future.

# ⚔️Combat system⚔️
A turn-based combat system with unique attacks and completely handmade animations with various effects.

Emojis have 5 health points, and each attack deals a specific amount of damage or healing. An emoji that reaches 0 health will die and lose the battle.

You need to battle and lower an emoji’s health to capture it, after which it becomes yours.
