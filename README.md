# 🌟EmojiRPG🌟
An RPG for Android using emojis for the graphics made from scratch in Android Studio.

This project is made with the purpose of learning and improving in Java/Android programming skills, and also to create a base for me to develop a bigger game at some point.

I made the base mechanics for the turn-based combat system, the visual novel system for conversations with NPCs, the team management system, a path tracking system for the overworld enemies, a gacha system and more.

The game is also filled with animations everywhere, all of them hand-made from scratch.


# ❓Why emojis?❓
Not having drawing skills, I decided to use emojis since they are a standard and good enough set of images that follow a specific and coherent artistic design, and the result looked good enough to be used.

Every graphic in the game uses emojis, from the characters to the battles and the scenery, with the only exception of the map background image.


# 💫Features💫

# 🗺️Interactive map🗺️
You are able to walk around the map and enter the location you want. There's a house for healing, a forest for combat, a library to manage your emojis team and more.  

More locations will be added in the future.

# ⚔️Combat system⚔️
A turn-based combat system with unique attacks and completelly hand-made animations with different effects.

The emojis have 5 health points, and every attack deals a specific damage or even heal, the emoji that reaches 0 health will die and lose the battle.

# 🤩Thousands of emojis🤩

Most of the emojis that exist are in the game so you can capture them, fight with them and collect them.

Your emojis will keep the health they have when the battle finishes, you need to heal them or they won't be able to start a fight again.
